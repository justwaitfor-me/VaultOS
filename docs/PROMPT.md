Here's an enhanced and more detailed AI prompt for your **VaultOS** project:

---

**AI Prompt:**

"Hello, I am developing **VaultOS**, a scalable home server dashboard designed for managing data, remote access, and cloud storage. The project utilizes the following tech stack:

- **Frontend:** Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Authentication:** Auth0

### Current Project State

The project is structured with separate backend and frontend directories. The **backend** is built with Node.js and Express, and it integrates MongoDB for data storage. Auth0 is used for secure user authentication. The **frontend** is built with Next.js, styled with TailwindCSS, and is set up to handle dynamic pages and components.

### Features Implemented

- **Dashboard:** Real-time data visualization (such as solar panel data) is the primary feature.
- **Cloud Storage:** A system to manage files and media, resembling Google Drive.
- **User Management:** Secure authentication using Auth0 for role-based access control.

### Development Steps Completed

- Initialized Git repository, created a basic directory structure, and set up essential files.
- Configured **MongoDB** and **Auth0** integration.
- Both the frontend and backend are ready for further development.
- A basic **README.md** has been created, outlining the project, installation steps, and future plans.

### Current Challenges

- Future enhancements like document editing, virtual desktops (Docker-based), PC management, and local AI integration need to be addressed.
- The system is being designed to be modular for easy future expansions.
- The goal is to ensure the project is scalable and optimized for both cloud and local hosting.

### Next Steps

I need help refining the project architecture and enhancing the security. I also want to implement the next features (such as document editing and virtual desktops). I would like to discuss and optimize how to:

- Improve the database structure and backend performance.
- Ensure security best practices for authentication, file management, and user roles.
- Implement a future-proof architecture that supports scalable cloud services and local AI hosting.
- Plan for the Docker-based virtual desktop and document editor integrations.

Please assist with the architectural design, security implementation, and planning for the future enhancements."
